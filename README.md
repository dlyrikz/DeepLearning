# DeepLearning

Welcome to Part 1 - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) !

First you will understand the theoretical concepts in Artificial Neural Networks like Neuron, Activation function, Cost function, Gradient Descent and Back-Propagation

After that you will work on 2 projects,

Priject 1: Multiclass image classification with ANN

Project 2: Binary Data Classification with ANN
